### Objective

Objective of the project is to build predictive models with supervised techniques to predict Rajasthan State Legislative Assembly Elections outcome.

### Approach

- Collect raw data from trusted sources - election websites on internet.
- Raw data preparation in Microsoft excels to run predictive models.
- Setting up data and variable preparation of variables in R Studio platform.
- Analyze significant variables and visualize data for assembly elections.
- Building CART – Regression Tree for target variable VOTE_SHARE [continuous variable]
- Analyze regression tree model performance on unseen dataset.
- Building Multinomial Logistic Regression model for target variable POSITION [categorical variable]
- Analyze model performance on unseen dataset for Rajasthan Assembly Elections 2013.
- Analyze model performance on unseen dataset for Rajasthan Assembly Elections 2008.
- Compare model performance and make conclusion.
