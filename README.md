### Objective

Objective of the project is to build predictive models with supervised techniques to predict Rajasthan State Legislative Assembly Elections outcome.

<br>

### Approach

- Collect raw data from trusted sources - election websites on internet.
- Raw data preparation in Microsoft excels to run predictive models.
- Setting up data and variable preparation of variables in R Studio platform.
- Analyze significant variables and visualize data for assembly elections.
- Building CART – Regression Tree for target variable VOTE_SHARE [continuous variable]
- Analyze regression tree model performance on unseen dataset.
- Building Multinomial Logistic Regression model for target variable POSITION [categorical variable]
- Analyze model performance on unseen dataset for Rajasthan Assembly Elections 2013.
- Analyze model performance on unseen dataset for Rajasthan Assembly Elections 2008.
- Compare model performance and make conclusion.

### Data Collection

Data Collection for Rajasthan Assembly Elections – 2013

For particular project data has been collected from various trusted sources from internet.

Election Commission of India: https://www.eci.gov.in/
My Neta: http://www.myneta.info/

In India, especially states like Rajasthan castes and party representative plays major role. Hence, highlighted variable are most important.

The data was acquired from Election Commission of India website for Rajasthan 2013 State Legislative Assembly Elections. However, same data was acquired from My Neta website fro same election year, state Rajasthan.

### Data Preparation



To check the Multinomial Logistic Regression model on unseen dataset we have also acquired data for Rajasthan 2008 State Legislative Assembly Elections from Election Commission of India website.
